# syntax-parsers

Sample grammars based on the book _Syntactic Theory_ by Sag, Wasow, and Bender.

## Getting Started

The system is designed to be run from within Eclipse or PyCharm, but you should be able to run the grammar by invoking

`python3 main.py`

from the src repository. Here, you can load the appropriate grammar and type in sample sentences, which the system will then try to parse.

### Prerequisites
